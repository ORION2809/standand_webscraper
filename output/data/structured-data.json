MetroNet's 100% fiber network offers symmetrical upload and download speeds (equally fast in both directions), unlike cable which typically has much slower upload speeds. Our fiber connection maintains consistent performance even during peak usage times, while cable internet often slows down when many people in your neighborhood are online. Additionally, fiber is more reliable and less susceptible to interference from weather conditions or electrical equipment."
